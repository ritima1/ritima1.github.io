## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is Ritima, and I set up this page to showcase some of the data science projects I've been working on.

I have experience in database manipulation/extraction, ML model development, and business communication. Much of my work is centered around building data science & machine learning applications to aid in decision making.

I have a background in teaching having taught various courses including **HR Analytics and Metrics**, **Applied HR Policies**, **Human Resources Planning** and **Training & Development** at degree and post-graduate level.

Seeking opportunities in a variety of industries to gain experience in data science, machine learning, strategy, analytics and experimentation. My resume has plenty of information about the professional projects I've worked on, but the purpose of this page is to showcase these projects in a more visual way. 

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:ritima1@gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritimam/). 

Thanks for reading,

Ritima
